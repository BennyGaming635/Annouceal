# Annouceal
***
# Why did you make this?
Look, I made this because I needed smh to make annoucements and stuff for me as I'm a train nerd and use it for simulations!

# Where does this work?
Currently only works on Windows 11. Let me know if you've tested it elsewhere!

# Whats added/whats next?
So far I've added;
- Pre-fab Annoucements
- Multiple voice types
- GUI!
- Natural Voices (Only works on Windows 11 - Sorry!)
- Start-tone (Like Heathrow Airport)
- Adjust speed and volume

This is what I'm adding next (In order hopefully)
1. Visual Annoucements
2. Smart Annoucements (E.g - Good morning in the morning or Good Evening in the arvo.)
3. Routes (Just gonna use Adelaide Metro's train and changes the annoucement based on the next station etc.)
